# ABOUT
[Netsmart's myAvatar™](https://www.ntst.com/Solutions-and-Services/Offerings/myAvatar) is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.

While myAvatar™ is a robust platform, like most things in life (except [Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition)), it isn't perfect.

The good news is that myAvatar™ functionality can be extended via Netsmart's myAvatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by myAvatar™ users.

The myAvatool Web Service (**MAWS**) is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for myAvatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.

## MAWS FEATURES
* Several built-in tools and utilities for use with myAvatar™
* Does not require Java to be installed
* A solid foundation to build additional myAvatar™ custom tools and utilities

## THE MANUAL
The [MAWS Manual](doc/man/manual.md) is updated with each release, and will walk you through setting up and using MAWS in your environments.

## REQUIREMENTS
* A location to host the Avatool Web Service which meets the following requirements:
  * .NET Framework 4.6+ installed
  * Access to your myAvatar™ environments from the Avatool Web Service via HTTPS

# USING MAWS AT YOUR ORGANIZATION
The [MAWS Manual](doc/man/manual.md) will walk your through setting up and using MAWS in your myAvatar™ environments.

# DEVELOPMENT
MAWS is developed by [A Pretty Cool Program](https://aprettycoolprogram.com) and these [contributors](src/Resources/Doc/contributors.md), using these [third-party resources](src/Resources/Doc/built-with.md).

To contribute to the development branch of MAWS, please see our [contributing guidelines](src/Resources/Doc/contributing.md).
