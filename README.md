# ABOUT
Archiwizator is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) front-end for [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

### Features
* Batch archiving!
* Simple file/folder cleanup prior to archiving data
* Metal music soundrack (coming soon!)
* Portable

# GETTING STARTED
### Before you begin
Archiwizator is a work in progress. It does what it is supposed to do, but not...gracefully. I would suggest that you take a look at the [known issues](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/Archiwizator/blob/development/src/Resources/Doc/known-issues.md) before using Archiwizinator.

### Prerequisites
* .NET Core 5.x

# INSTALLING

### Windows
1. Download the current [Archiwizinator-X.x.zip](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/Archiwizator/releases/tag/v0.905-beta) file
2. Extract `Archiwizator-X.x.zip` to whatever directory you want it to reside

#### Other operating systems
While Archiwizator is written in .NET Core C#, and much of it is cross-platform, it does utilize WPF technology, and is therefore Windows-only.

# USING
To start Archiwizator:
1. Go to your Archiwizator directory
2. Double-click `Archiwizator.exe`

### There is a manual!
The Archiwizator [manual](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/Archiwizator/blob/development/src/Resources/Doc/Manual/manual.md) is updated when a new version is released, and is the best way to learn how to use Archiwizator.

# UPDATING
Since Archiwizator is portable, you just need to replace the old version with the new version.

# UNINSTALLING
Since Archiwizator is portable, you just need to delete the location where Archiwizator resides.

# HOW IT WORKS
Archiwizator is a front-end for [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org).

# DEVELOPMENT
Archiwizator is developed by [A Pretty Cool Program](https://aprettycoolprogram.com) and these [contributors](src/Resources/Doc/contributors.md), using these [third-party resources](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/Archiwizator/blob/development/src/Resources/Doc/built-with.md).

You can find the development branch of Archiwizator [here](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/Archiwizator/tree/development).
