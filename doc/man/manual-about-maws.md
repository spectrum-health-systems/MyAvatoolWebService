# ABOUT MAWS
The myAvatool Web Service (**MAWS**) is a custom web service for [Netsmart's myAvatar™ EHR](https://www.ntst.com/Solutions-and-Services/Offerings/myAvatar) which includes various tools and utilities that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently. 

More information about MAWS, from the README, will go here.

More information about the project will go here (i.e. other projects, etc).
