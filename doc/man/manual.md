# ABOUT MAWS
[Netsmart's myAvatar™](https://www.ntst.com/Solutions-and-Services/Offerings/myAvatar) is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.

While myAvatar™ is a robust platform, like most things in life (except [Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition)), it isn't perfect.

The good news is that myAvatar™ functionality can be extended via Netsmart's myAvatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by myAvatar™ users.

The myAvatool Web Service (**MAWS**) is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for myAvatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.

## MAWS FEATURES
* Several built-in tools and utilities for use with myAvatar™
* A solid foundation to build additional custom tools and utilities

## MAWS REQUIREMENTS
* A location to host the Avatool Web Service
* Access to your myAvatar™ environments from the Avatool Web Service via HTTPS

## ABOUT THIS MANUAL
Some components of the Avatool Web Service will need to be customized before they can be used at your organization.

These components, and the customization that they require, are detailed various documents in this repository. You'll know what needs to be changed, and what it needs to be changed to, as long as you follow the instructions
