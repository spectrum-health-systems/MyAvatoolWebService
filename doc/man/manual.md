The current version of MAWS is v0.8.x.

I'm working on getting MAWS v1.0 out the door, so for now this sourcecode in very beta, so DO NOT use this version. It's only here becuase I'm trying to keep the GitHub repository history clean.

If you are looking for something to use right now, check out the [Avatool Web Service](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Avatool-Web-Service), which is the the precursor to MAWS.

# THE myAVATOOL WEB SERVICE (MAWS)
[Netsmart's myAvatar™](https://www.ntst.com/Solutions-and-Services/Offerings/myAvatar) is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.

While myAvatar™ is a robust platform, like most things in life (except [Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition)), it isn't perfect.

The good news is that myAvatar™ functionality can be extended via Netsmart's myAvatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by myAvatar™ users.

The myAvatool Web Service (**MAWS**) is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for myAvatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.

## MAWS FEATURES
* Several built-in tools and utilities for use with myAvatar™
* Does not require Java to be installed
* A solid foundation to build additional myAvatar™ custom tools and utilities

## DON'T FORGET THE MANUAL!
The MAWS Manual (which you are reading *right now*) is updated with each release, and will walk you through setting up and using MAWS in your environments.

## WANT TO START FROM SCRATCH?
In the event that you would like to create your own custom web service for myAvatar™, I've outlined the steps I took to create MAWS [here](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/MyAvatoolWebService/blob/main/doc/man/manual-custom-web-services.md).
