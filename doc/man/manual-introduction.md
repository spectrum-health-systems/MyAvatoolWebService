# INTRODUCTION
[Netsmart's myAvatar™](https://www.ntst.com/Solutions-and-Services/Offerings/myAvatar) is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.

While myAvatar™ is a robust platform, like most things in life (except [Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition)), it isn't perfect.

The good news is that myAvatar™ functionality can be extended via Netsmart's myAvatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by myAvatar™ users.

The myAvatool Web Service (**MAWS**) is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for myAvatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.

## MAWS FEATURES
* Several built-in tools and utilities for use with myAvatar™
* Does not require Java to be installed
* A solid foundation to build additional myAvatar™ custom tools and utilities

## MAWS REQUIREMENTS
* A location to host MAWS that is available to your myAvatar™ environments via HTTPS.

# THE MAWS MANUAL
This manual will walk you through the requirements of using MAWS in your environments, which include:
* [Hosting MAWS](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/MyAvatoolWebService/blob/main/doc/man/manual-hosting-maws.md) on a web server that you myAvatar™ environments have access to
* [Importing MAWS](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/MyAvatoolWebService/blob/main/doc/man/manual-importing-maws.md) into your myAvatar™ environments
* [Using MAWS](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/MyAvatoolWebService/blob/main/doc/man/manual-using-maws.md) in your myAvatar™ environments.

# CREATING YOUR OWN CUSTOM MYAVATAR™ WEB SERVICE
In the event that you would like to create your own custom web service for myAvatar™, I've outlined the steps I took to create MAWS [here](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/MyAvatoolWebService/blob/main/doc/man/manual-custom-web-services.md).
